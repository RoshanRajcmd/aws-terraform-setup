### How to Use Terraform for AWS?

To use Terraform for AWS, you need to do the following:

1. **Install Terraform**:
    
    Download and install Terraform on your local machine. You can follow the instructions on [Terraform‚Äôs website](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html).
    
2. **Install and Set up AWS CLI and Credentials**:
    - Install the **AWS CLI** in your local and configure it with your AWS credentials (access key ID and secret access key) (You can get the access ID & Key - Got to AWS dashbord click your AWS id on the top right corner ‚Üí Security credentials ‚Üí Under ‚ÄúAccess Key section‚Äù click Create access key ‚Üí Click CLI ‚Üí Click next and Create ‚Üí There is your ID & Key to copy) .
    - Run `AWS configure` to set your credentials, default region, and output format. Alternatively, you can use environment variables like `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, and `AWS_REGION`.

4. **Initialize Terraform**:
    In your terminal, navigate to the directory where your `.tf` file is located and run `terraform init` to initialize the configuration and download necessary providers (such as AWS, Azure, etc.).

5. **Plan the Infrastructure**:
    Run `terraform plan` to see what changes Terraform will make to your AWS environment.

6. **Apply the Configuration**:
If you‚Äôre satisfied with the plan, run `terraform apply` to apply the changes and provision the resources.

7. To **destroy** the resources when you're done, run `terraform destroy`

### Variables
    - You can give other values to these variable by defining it while running terraform apply.
        Example cmd: terraform apply -var "instance_name=RoshansInstance"
    - Alternatively you can use the terraform.tfvars to set values to the variable defined in your variables.tf file.
